FILE "Model.py": Is the file where you create and trained the model
FILE "mnistV2.h5" Is the model who can correctly predict +80% of the results
FILE "draw.py" This is where you create the UI to draw the numbers and use the model to predict
Clone the repository and run the "draw.py" file to test the model.
